Tools to help you edit and repair Unity/VRChat projects. This package doesn't require any VRChat SDK to be installed in the project to work.

For a list of available tools, and a couple of guides, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities/wiki)!

## Installation

Get latest or past Unity Packages from [Releases](https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities/releases).

There is also support for [VRChat Creator Companion's VPM](https://facs01-01.github.io/FACS-VPM-Listing/)!
